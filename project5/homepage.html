            <h2>How To Cook When You Finally Upgrade From Your Mini Fridge and Microwave</h2>
            <p>Are you a college student trying to navigate the world of cooking for yourself for the first time? Maybe you are living in your first apartment and trying to find new ways to spice up your meals. Well, look no further! This website is going to be your crash course to everything you need to know about cooking delicious, easy meals for yourself.</p>
            <p>Cooking for yourself can feel both liberating and stress-inducing. I am learning how to navigate the world of living in an apartment without a meal plan or parents to cook for me for the first time this semester. College life can be extremely hectic with classes, exams, and social activities which can leave little time for cooking. But that doesnâ€™t mean we should have to sacrifice flavor and nutrition. This website is going to be my guide to my favorite meals, as well as tips and tricks I have learned so far!</p>

        <h2>Benifits To Cooking At Home</h2>
        <h3>Although there are many premade or delivery options nowadays there are still many benefits to cooking fresh homemade food.</h3>
        <p>Healthier Choice: When you cook at home, you can have full control over what ingredients you are using in your meals which allows you to make healthier choices. Some common examples are reducing the amount of salt, sugar, or unhealthy fats you use in your meals.</p>
        <p>Customization: Cooking meals for yourself can be helpful especially if you are working around food allergies or sensitivities. This allows you to customize your meals to your specific dietary preferences and restrictions. Some common examples of specific diets could be vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian.</p>
        <p>Portion Control: When you eat out or premade meals you are being served portions that are two or three times larger than the recommended dietary guidelines. Being able to control the portion size can help you manage your calorie intake to maintain a healthy weight.</p>
        <p>Better Quality Ingredients: When you cook for yourself you also must shop for yourself which means you can pick out fresh, high-quality ingredients. This will not only have benefits for your body but also it will enhance the flavor of your dishes.</p>
        <p>Cost Saving: Home cooking can be beneficial because oftentimes it can be more cost-effective than eating out or getting takeout. You can buy ingredients in bulk, plan meals ahead of time, and minimize food waste which all save money in the long run.</p>
