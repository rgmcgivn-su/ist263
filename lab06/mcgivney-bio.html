                I have 2 sisters one older and one younger who both attended/attend Syracuse University with me. My family is all very close although we don’t see each other too often around campus we spend a lot of time together at home. Me and my younger sister even worked together this past summer which was so fun! I’m very excited to learn all this class has to teach me and cannot wait for the future.
