                <p>Although cooking for yourself can be a big responsibility and does take some preparation and planning it can also be rewarding and fun when done right. In this section, I will be going over some of my roommates and my favorite meals to cook and what you will need to complete each on your own. You can also make as many modifications to these recipes as you need, I am just including how I cook it and then you can go from there!</p>

            <h4>Tacos</h4>
            <p>Every (or at least most) Tuesday nights in our apartment we have a tradition where we make tacos together for dinner. This is my personal favorite meal to make so I usually take the lead. We luckily have a stove in our apartment so that is a key factor you are going to need when making this.</p>
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>2lbs. ground beef: $13.00</li>
                <li>Taco seasoning packet: $1.00</li>
                <li>Taco shells: $3.00</li>
                <li>Romaine lettuce: $4.00</li>
                <li>Tomatoes: $3.00</li>
                <li>Cheese: $5.00</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> First, you are going to cook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat for 8-10 minutes. You are going to want to make sure you are stirring the meat occasionally until it turns brown. Once your meat is finished cooking you are going to drain the excess liquid in the pan. Then you are going to add your taco seasoning packet to the beef and stir until it is all mixed in. You are also going to want to chop up your tomatoes and lettuce to use as toppings. From there just place everything in separate serving bowls and plate them as you like!</p>

            <h4>Pasta Salad</h4>
            <p>Pasta salad is a staple in our household because of how versatile it can be. We prefer to make them at the beginning of the week so that we can snack on it whenever we get hungry in addition to usually eating it as a meal on the first day.</p>
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pasta: $2.00</li>
                <li>Tomatoes: $3.00</li>
                <li>Baby cucumbers: $3.00</li>
                <li>Mozzarella cheese pearls: $4.00</li>
                <li>16 oz bottle of Italian-style dressing: $3.00</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> First, you are going to want to bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. You are going to cook your pasta in boiling water and stir it occasionally for about 10-12 minutes depending on your pasta. When your pasta has finished cooking you are going to drain the water and put pasta in a large bowl. From here you are going to want to chop up all your other ingredients including the tomatoes, cucumbers, and mozzarella. Next, combine all your chopped ingredients with your pasta in a large bowl. Finally, to complete the pasta salad pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. I prefer when my ingredients have some time to sit and combine so I usually let it sit for a few hours and then enjoy!</p>

            <h4>Chicken Noodle Soup</h4>
            <p>Soup is another one of our top meals in this household, especially in the colder months here in Syracuse. Our favorite is chicken noodle soup but there are so many amazing recipes for different soups on the internet you could use as well.</p>
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1/2 cup of chopped onions: $1.50</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of chopped celery: $2.00</li>
                <li>5 cans of chicken broth: $7.00</li>
                <li>1/2 pound of chopped cooked chicken breast: $10.00</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups of egg noodles: $1.50</li>
                <li>1 cup sliced carrots: $2.00</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> First, you want to melt your butter in a large pot over medium heat. From here you are going to want to add your onion and celery and cook them just until they are tender which should be about 5 minutes. Then you want to add your chicken broth, chicken, egg noodles, carrots, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and bring this to a boil. Finally, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. The soup will be ready to enjoy after this, you can store and enjoy it for days.</p>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h5>In conclusion...</h5>
        <p>These are just 3 staple meals in my personal household to give you ideas for how to get creative in the kitchen. All three of these options are delicious and great sources of nutrition but my favorite part of all three is how versatile they are. I can think of at least 2-3 ways to change up each of these recipes to include different ingredients, so I donâ€™t get sick of eating the same thing repeatedly.</p>
